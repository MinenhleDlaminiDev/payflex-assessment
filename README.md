## Overview

This project showcases a production-grade Angular component implementation that mirrors PayFlex's existing design system and user experience patterns. The component was developed with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and user experience, following the same standards used in PayFlex's production environment.

## Production Design Implementation

### Design System Alignment
The component strictly adheres to PayFlex's production design system by:
- Implementing the exact color scheme used in production (#CFA3FF for highlights and #002751 for primary text), with minor adjustments
- Following PayFlex's typography standards and font hierarchy
- Using consistent spacing and padding measurements
- Maintaining brand identity through proper logo placement and styling
- Implementing standardized button styles and interactive elements

### Modal Implementation
Following PayFlex's production pattern, the edit functionality is implemented through a modal interface because:
- It maintains consistency with existing PayFlex user interactions
- Provides a focused editing environment
- Prevents accidental navigation during form editing
- Matches the production user experience flow

### Layout Structure
The component's layout mirrors PayFlex's production dashboard structure:
- Main content area with standardized padding
- Profile header with cover image and profile picture
- Information grid layout matching production spacing
- Bootstrap grid system used to layout user information
- Responsive breakpoints matching production values

## Detailed Feature Implementation

### User Profile Component

- Two-Way Data Binding: Implements both property and event binding for seamless data updates
- Dynamic Content: Uses ngFor directive for flexible hobby list rendering
- Responsive Design: Implements Bootstrap's grid system with custom breakpoints
- Modal Form: Matches PayFlex's production modal implementation for consistency

### Data Management
- HTTP Integration: Implements robust error handling and retry logic
- Service Layer: Created UserService layer for data management
- Error States: Provides user-friendly error messages and recovery options
- Loading States: Shows loading indicators during data fetches

### Form Implementation
- Reactive Forms: Uses FormGroup and FormControl for robust form management
- Validation Rules: Implements business-specific validation requirements
- Real-time Validation: Provides immediate feedback on user input
- Error Messages: Displays clear, user-friendly validation messages
- Form State Management: Tracks and manages form dirty/pristine states

### Styling and Layout
